Parcel
Parcel is bundler which make react fast

Parcel Advantages

1) Zero Configuration

Parcel supports many languages and file types out of the box from web technologies to assets like images, fonts videos

2) dev server => mean you can ignite the app like npx parcel index.html
3) Hot reloading
Parcel also integrates with React Fast Refresh and the Vue Hot Reloading API to automatically preserve your application state between updates.
4) Diagnostics
If you make an error in your code or configuration, Parcel displays beautiful diagnostics in your terminal and in the browser.

5) Reliable caching => .parcel-cache
6) multi core
7) Lazy dev builds
In development, Parcel can defer building files until they are requested in the browser. 
This means you only need to wait for the page you're actually working on to build!
And when you do request a page, Parcel is smart enough to eagerly build all of the dependencies of that page 
at once, without waiting for them to be requested as well â€“ no network waterfalls!
